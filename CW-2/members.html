            <p>In 2012, Rosé's father found out that YG Entertainment was holding their auditions in Sydney, Australia. He convinced her to take part in it. Despite Rosé's mother not agreeing at first, Rosé and her father were able to convince her mother at the end. She quickly went to Sydney, coming all the way from Melbourne. Rosé ranked first in the auditions, beating 700 others, and became a trainee at YG Entertainment on the same day. After training for four years, YG finally put her as the main vocalist and lead dancer of BLACKPINK. She was the last member to be revealed in the band.</p>
            <p>Less than 6 months after joining YG, Rosé featured on G-Dragon's One of a Kind EP, on the track "Without You".</p>

            <p>On January 25, 2021, it was reported that Rosé will be performing a song from her solo album for the first time at BLACKPINK's upcoming concert BLACKPINK: The Show.

            <p>On February 10, 2021, YG Entertainment announced that Rosé will be making her solo debut sometime in March. It was also stated that they have finished filming the M/V for Rosé’s title song from her debut solo album. They are currently ensuring it’s completeness due to the large amount of production fee.
